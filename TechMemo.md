# Technical Memo

This technical memo documents the Command Line Interface (CLI) that has been developed for the Landfill Labs Worker Service Prototype. This CLI has been developed so that the system can be demonstrated/used by the council, allowing them to provide some initial feedback to the development team before the full Worker Service (in the form of a SpringBatch application) is developed. As the lead of the testing team on this project, you're expected to test this prototype version of the system before we give it to the council. To assist with this, we have put together the following use cases for the CLI (you should consider these alongside the Spec_v1 document and the Worked Example detailed as a part of the Memorandum of Understanding).
